    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "With our randomly generated responses (percent reacted) and with our random seed (42), we find that increasing the Catalyst level is the most impactful, single factor that can improve percent reacted with a 6% contribution. An overall grading of factors is as follows in the following form (Factor, Percented Reacted Change)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Catalyst (+6%)\n",
    "2) Temperature (+1.4%)\n",
    "3) Feed Rate (-6%)\n",
    "4) Concentration (-7.9%)\n",
    "5) Stir Rate (-18.7%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that increasing the level of Feed Rate, Concentration, and Stir Rate negatively impacts percent reacted if we are examining these factors indvidually. However, the individual examinination in itself doesn't fully capture coupled impacts, therefore investigating combonations of factors percented reacted change is more valuable. I generated 121 combonations of different factors and ultimately found some combonations of the 5 factors yield the best mean change in percent reacted. For example the top 2 combonations include:\n",
    "                     \n",
    "1) Feed Rate x Catalyst x Stir Rate x Temperature x Concentration (Level (10, 1, 120, 140)) which has a Percent Reacted Change of +45.6%\n",
    "2) Feed Rate x Catalyst x Stir Rate x Temperature x Concentration (Level (15, 1, 120, 180)) which has a Percented Reacted Change of +42.6%\n",
    "\n",
    "In esssence, if we have those factors with their accompanying factors and then increase the concentration, this will dramatically and postiviely impact our overall chemcial reaction percent reacted. Following these combos of 5 factors, the next most impactful combos are 4 factors that follow a similar trend. Commenting on some pair combonations, the top two paired combonations positively impacting percent reacted are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Feed Rate x Catalyst (Level 15) which has a Percent Reacted Change of +18%\n",
    "2) Feed Rate x Temperature (Level 10) which has a Percent Reacted Change of +12.7%\n",
    "3) Catalyst x Concentration (Level 1) which has a Percent Reacted Change of +6.7%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As evidenced, each of these factors has unique, coupled impacts when combined and it's important to understand the nuance associated with each of these. If I was an engineer on this experiment, I would keep in the back of my mind the overall net increase that increasing the catalyst level can bring, however, I would specifically pay attention to the coupled impacts with multiple factors and atttempt to understand the underlying phyiscal reasoning to better increase the overall net, percent reacted for my chemical reactions."
